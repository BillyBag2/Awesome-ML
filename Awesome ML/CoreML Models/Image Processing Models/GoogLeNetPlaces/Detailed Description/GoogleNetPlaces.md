# Description

Scene recognition is one of the hallmark tasks of computer vision, allowing defining a context for object recognition. Here we introduce a new scene-centric database called Places, with 205 scene categories and 2.5 millions of images with a category label. Using convolutional neural network (CNN), we learn deep scene features for scene recognition tasks, and establish new state-of-the-art performances on scene-centric benchmarks.

## Input

A color (224x224) image.

## Output

Most likely scene label.
